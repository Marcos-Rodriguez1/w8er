            Unfortunately, we are a not like Yelp, you can't browse a listing of
            restaurants and just waitlist or reserve ðŸ™ƒ. However, you can
            continue using Yelp or your favorite way to find restaurants. As
            long as a restaurant signs up for our service, they will advertise a
            QR code or a link, you can use those two ways to waitlist or
            reserve. The restaurant may advertise the link on their Yelp page or
            on their website. They may have the QR code posted out on their
            storefront.
